Overview of User Registration System
Introduction
This project is a User Registration System implemented in Python. It provides functionality for managing user data, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting user records. The system uses a text file (user_data.txt) to store user information, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

Key Features
Initialize User File
Ensures the file user_data.txt is created if it doesn't already exist.
Adds a header row (ID,Name,Email) when initializing.
Add User
Allows the user to input and save new user details (ID, Name, Email).
Display Users
Reads and displays all the user records stored in the file.
Update User
Updates the name and/or email of an existing user based on the user ID.
Delete User
Deletes a user record by their unique ID.
Error Handling
Includes exceptions to handle file-related errors, input errors, and other runtime issues.

How It Works
1. File Storage
User data is stored in a file named user_data.txt. The first line is a header, and each subsequent line contains a user's data in the format:
Copy code
ID,Name,Email


2. Initialization
When the program starts, it checks for the existence of user_data.txt. If the file doesn't exist, it creates one and adds the header row.
3. Menu Interaction
The program provides a menu with the following options:
Add User: Allows you to add new user records.
Display All Users: Displays the content of the user_data.txt file.
Update User: Updates user information for a given ID.
Delete User: Deletes the user record for a given ID.
Exit: Exits the application.

Example Usage
Initializing the File
When running the program for the first time:
arduino
Copy code
File 'user_data.txt' created successfully.


Adding a User
Example:
sql
Copy code
Enter User ID: 1
Enter User Name: Alice
Enter User Email: alice@example.com
User 'Alice' added successfully.


Displaying All Users
Output:
sql
Copy code
--- User Data ---
ID,Name,Email
1,Alice,alice@example.com


Updating a User
Example:
sql
Copy code
Enter User ID to update: 1
Enter new name (leave blank to keep unchanged): Alice Johnson
Enter new email (leave blank to keep unchanged): 
User ID 1 updated successfully.


Deleting a User
Example:
sql
Copy code
Enter User ID to delete: 1
User ID 1 deleted successfully.



Error Handling
File Not Found: Ensures that the program gracefully handles missing files by creating a new one.
Invalid Input: Prompts the user for correct input when invalid data is entered.
Permission Issues: Displays a meaningful error message if the program cannot access the file.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Conclusion
The User Registration System is a simple and effective way to manage user records using Python. It demonstrates the use of file handling, exception handling, and basic user interaction through a text-based menu.
